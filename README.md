# UFOs

## Overview
To create a visual webpage with a filterable table of UFO data that was originally stored as a JavaScript array. 

## Purpose
To create a user friendly, searchable interface of UFO sightings including location, date, and descriptive information.

# Results
We now have a working, searchable interface that is both easy to use and visually appealing.

# Summary 
One drawback of this is that it is not self-updating.   The original data array will need to be updated manually periodically.

A couple of recommendations I would add is to update the java array to be more grammicatcally correct. Capital letters for cities and states for example.
Also adding code to automaically update the the array to keep the information up-to-date.
